# Descriptive Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on descriptive data analysis, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of a dataset through various statistical techniques and visualizations. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and summarization to derive meaningful insights.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizing statistical summaries and visualizations to explore the dataset.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying various statistical techniques to summarize the data.
- **Visualization**: Creating informative plots and graphs to represent the data visually.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Generating summary statistics and visualizations.
3. **Statistical Summaries**: Calculating measures of central tendency and dispersion.
4. **Visualization**: Using plots to reveal patterns, trends, and outliers.

## Results

The analysis results are documented in the Final Report.pdf, including various statistical findings and visual representations of the data. Key findings and significant insights are highlighted to provide a clear understanding of the dataset.
